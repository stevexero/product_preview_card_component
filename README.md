## Overview

In this challenge, I will be continuing my focus on semantically correct HTML, accessibility, responsive Less CSS, and BEM. In the design files, while I'm measuring, I'll run by small inconsistencies in spacing between elements, So I'll also be focusing on using consistent layout settings.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
